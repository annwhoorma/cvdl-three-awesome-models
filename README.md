## Project Description

This project is aimed to detect recycling codes: PP (5), PAP (20-22), ALU (41). 

## Data Acquisition and Annotation

I took photos of whatever I found at home. You can see examples below:


Since I didn't have much of aluminium stuff, the dataset is a bit unbalanced. The statistics is the following:

| Class name | Images count | Objects count |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| PAP        | 31           | 32            |
| POL        | 36           | 37            |
| ALU        | 29           | 29            |

The numbers of in _Objects Count_ column is different from the numbers in _Objects Count_ column because some images contain more than 1 class.
